## 4. User Experience Flow

### 4.1 Initial Learning Phase (Per Check Type)

#### Step 1: Check Introduction
```
AI: "I'm learning how to collect evidence for 'Access Control Review - SOC 2'. 
Can you walk me through what evidence we typically need?"

User: "We need user access reports from Active Directory, privileged account lists, 
and access review documentation from the last quarter."

AI: "Got it. Let me break this down into steps:
1. Extract user access report from Active Directory
2. Generate privileged account inventory
3. Collect quarterly access review documents
Is this the right approach?"
```

#### Step 2: Detailed Step Learning
```
AI: "For Step 1 - Active Directory report, where should I look for this?"

User: "Check the IT Compliance folder in Google Drive, usually named 
'AD_User_Report_YYYY-MM.xlsx'"

AI: "I'll look in /IT Compliance/ for files matching that pattern. 
Should I always take the most recent one?"

User: "Yes, and if there are multiple versions, pick the one with 'FINAL' in the name."
```

#### Step 3: Validation & Refinement
```
AI: "I've collected the evidence following our discussion. Here's what I found:
- AD_User_Report_2025-09_FINAL.xlsx (2,450 users)
- Privileged_Accounts_Q3-2025.pdf (47 accounts)
- Access_Review_Sept2025_Complete.docx (Approved by CISO)

Does this look correct for 'Access Control Review - SOC 2'?"

User: "Perfect! Also remember to always check if the CISO signature is present 
in the access review document."

AI: "Added to memory: Validate CISO signature in access review documents 
for this check type."
```

### 4.2 Autonomous Operation Phase

#### Step 1: Check Assignment
```
AI: "I've been assigned 15 checks for this compliance cycle. 
Based on my learning, here's my execution plan:

Access Control Review - SOC 2 (3 instances):
- Confidence: 95% (learned from previous interactions)
- Estimated time: 8 minutes per instance
- Special considerations: Validate CISO signatures

Business Continuity Testing (2 instances):
- Confidence: 78% (some uncertainty about recent process changes)
- Estimated time: 12 minutes per instance
- Question: Should I still check the old backup system or focus on new AWS setup?

Would you like me to proceed with high-confidence items first?"
```

#### Step 2: Real-Time Execution Display
```
Current Task: Access Control Review - SOC 2 (Instance 1/3)

Step 1/4: Accessing IT Compliance folder...

‚ö†Ô∏è  Found 2 files: Q2-2025.pdf, Q3-2025.pdf
‚ùì Which should I use? (Pausing for guidance)

üí¨ Chat: "Use Q3 - it's more recent for this compliance cycle"
‚úÖ Selected: Privileged_Accounts_Q3-2025.pdf

Step 4/4: Validating access review documentation...
‚úÖ Found: Access_Review_Sept2025_Complete.docx
üîç Checking for CISO signature... ‚úÖ Present (J. Smith, Sept 20, 2025)

```

### 4.3 Interactive Modification Flow

#### Real-Time Step Changes
```
AI: "Currently executing Step 2: Collecting firewall configuration files...
üîç Accessing /Network/Firewalls/Configs/"

User: "Wait, check the new location: /Security/Infrastructure/Firewall-Backups/"

AI: "Switching to new path: /Security/Infrastructure/Firewall-Backups/
üîç Found 23 configuration files. Should I update my memory to use this 
location for future firewall evidence collection?"

User: "Yes, and always grab the weekly backup files, not daily ones."

AI: "Memory updated:
- New firewall config path: /Security/Infrastructure/Firewall-Backups/
- File preference: Weekly backups over daily
This will apply to all future firewall-related evidence collection."
```
